A bunch of code that implements the Kamada-Kawai and Fruchterman-Reingold graph-layout functions in 2D and 3D.

Source is the coffee files, compiled are in raw javascript. See compiled.html to actually run it. Does not include the image files used in the GUI.

It can be seen online at http://www.richardlyon.co.uk/coffeegraph

Requires:
 - jQuery latest
 - RaphaelJS (for 2D rendering)
 - THREE.js (for 3D rendering, latest builds may break)
